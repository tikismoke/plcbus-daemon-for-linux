******************************************************************************
Requirements:
******************************************************************************

- Installed Linux distribution (other platforms may also be supported, or not,
	your mileage may vary).
- The plcbus deamon server: plcbus.pl
- Required Module originally written by Ron Frazer: IOSelectBurrered.pm

******************************************************************************
Installation
******************************************************************************

- Save plcbus.pl into an executable directory (I use /usr/local/bin) and make it
	executable.
- Save IOSelectBurrered.pm into a directory called SerialLibs (note the use of
	uppercase letters) in one of the standard perl module locations (for 
	instance /etc/perl/SerialLibs).
- To see what options plcbus offers, execute:
	plcbus.pl --help
- Run the server in background with any required options, i.e."
	plcbus.pl --device=/dev/ttyUSB0 --port=1221 --phase=3 &

******************************************************************************
Usage
******************************************************************************

Send commands from any network connected pc in the following format:

homeunit,command,[data1],[data2]

where:
- homeunit is the desired PLCBUS unit address (A1 - A16 though P1 - P16).
- command is the appropriate command (see the output of plcbus.pl for a list).
- data1 is a decimal value between 0 and 100 (if required by the command).
- data2 is a decimal value between 0 and 100 (if required by the command).

If you wish to interact with the server in a interactive session use netcat to
connect as follows:
	netcat localhost 5151
and type your commands. If the server is on a networked pc replace
'localhost' with the hostname or ip address as necessary (likewise with the
port number if you ran plcbus.pl with a non-default value).  To exit the
session simply type 'exit'.

If you wish to send commands in a single-shot method (i.e. from a script) try
the following:
	echo -e 'a1,preset_dim,50,2\nexit\n' | nc localhost 5151
replacing the command, data values, hostname and port as necessary.

plcbus.pl is also aware of commands sent by other transmitters (i.e. PLCBUS-2269 Scene Controller) and will display any and all messages that are not a result of activity from the local 1141.  Any messgages will be stored and displayed the next time a command is sent.  You can also check for any stored messages by sending a blank command (i.e. a newline).
